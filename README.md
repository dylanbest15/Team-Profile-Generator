# Team-Profile-Generator
This application will generate a team profile for the user utilizing Node.js and Inquirer NPM prompts. The user can run the app on and follow the prompts to enter their team which can include any number of Managers, Engineers, and Interns. The app will then write to the team.html file and create a website to showcase the team profile which will inlude each member's name, employee id, and email. It will also include the office number for managers, the github username for engineers, and the school for interns.
